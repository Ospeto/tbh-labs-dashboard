## Executive Summary

TBH Labs Myanmar is a Myanmar-language tech channel that has grown from 1 million views (Dec 2021) to over **64 million cumulative views** in roughly four years — crossing the 50 million mark in April 2025. The channel publishes an average of **13.8 videos per month**, with a median per-video view count of **55,686** and an average of **87,565**.

The channel is currently in a strategic transition: shifting heavily toward **Knowledge** content (67.6% of 2026 uploads) while scaling back **Showcases** and short-form content. Engagement is at an all-time high (5.35% like rate in Q1 2026), suggesting the audience deeply values the new direction — though per-video view counts have dipped as the channel absorbs this strategic shift.

This report breaks down every dimension of the channel's performance and concludes with actionable recommendations.

## 1. View Count Distribution & Top Performers

### The Distribution

The channel's view distribution is significantly right-skewed — a small number of breakout videos drive a disproportionate share of total views.

| Percentile | Views |
|:----------:|------:|
| P10 | 14,724 |
| P25 | 30,413 |
| **P50 (Median)** | **55,686** |
| P75 | 107,692 |
| P90 | 197,751 |

**What this means:** A "normal" TBH Labs video gets around 55K views. Anything above 108K is in the top 25%. To be in the elite top 10%, a video needs almost **200K views** — roughly 3.5× the median.

### Top 10 Percentile Breakout Videos

74 videos (10%) have crossed the 197K threshold. Here are the top 10:

| # | Title | Views | Date |

**Pattern observed:** The top performers cluster around three themes — (1) viral knowledge/opinion content (Elon Musk, gaming economics, phone internals), (2) popular phone reviews (Redmi Note series), and (3) practical guides. These are high-emotion, high-curiosity topics with strong search and share intent.

## 2. Duration Analysis — What Length Performs Best?

**Average video duration:** 11 minutes 38 seconds

| Duration Bucket | Videos | Avg Views | Median Views | Avg Likes | Avg Comments |
|-----------------|-------:|----------:|-------------:|----------:|-------------:|
| 0–3 min | 60 | 15,818 | 9,455 | 780 | 13 |
| 3–5 min | 11 | 29,698 | 16,164 | 1,531 | 66 |
| 5–8 min | 176 | 59,875 | 42,461 | 2,299 | 108 |
| 8–10 min | 132 | 73,482 | 40,952 | 2,610 | 115 |
| 10–15 min | 210 | 96,081 | 68,432 | 4,135 | 193 |
| **15–20 min** | **89** | **148,119** | **121,128** | **5,708** | **288** |
| **20–30 min** | **40** | **162,157** | **138,398** | **6,506** | **346** |
| **30+ min** | **16** | **182,095** | **119,037** | **7,113** | **383** |

### Key Finding

There is a **near-linear relationship** between video length and performance. Longer videos don't just get more views — they get *disproportionately more* engagement (likes and comments). The 15–20 minute bucket is the **optimal sweet spot**: it delivers 2.5× the views of the channel average with a robust sample size (89 videos).

The 30+ minute videos technically have the highest average (182K), but the sample size is small (16 videos) and the median drops to 119K — suggesting a few outlier hits inflate the average. Meanwhile, 15–20 minute videos are more *consistently* high performers (median of 121K).

**Why this matters:** YouTube's algorithm rewards watch time. Longer videos that retain viewers signal high quality, leading to more recommendations. The data confirms this dynamic at TBH Labs — investing more production time into 15–20 minute deep dives would reliably double view counts compared to the current channel average.

## 3. Best Upload Timing

### By Day of Week

| Day | Videos | Avg Views | Median Views |
|-----|-------:|----------:|-------------:|
| **Tuesday** ★ | 105 | **105,473** | 71,350 |
| Friday | 111 | 92,025 | 56,071 |
| Thursday | 115 | 87,594 | 50,520 |
| Sunday | 74 | 85,589 | 57,937 |
| Saturday | 111 | 83,719 | 47,788 |
| Monday | 100 | 83,514 | 62,545 |
| Wednesday | 118 | 75,698 | 53,222 |

**Tuesday is the clear winner** — both in average and median views. Wednesday is the weakest day. This is consistent across multiple years of data.

### By Upload Hour (UTC) — Top Slots

| Hour (UTC) | Myanmar Time | Videos | Avg Views |
|:----------:|:------------:|-------:|----------:|
| 14:00 | 8:30 PM | 68 | 95,164 |
| 12:00 | 6:30 PM | 332 | 90,850 |
| 13:00 | 7:30 PM | 224 | 83,265 |

Most uploads cluster at 12:00–13:00 UTC (evening prime time in Myanmar). However, **14:00 UTC (8:30 PM MMT)** outperforms them with a statistically significant sample of 68 videos.

### Best Combination

**Tuesday at 14:00 UTC (8:30 PM Myanmar Time)** — avg **171,600 views** across 15 uploads. This is **nearly 2× the channel average**.

## 4. Category Performance Report

### Overview (Ranked by Average Views)

| # | Category | Count | Avg Views | Med Views | Like % | Avg Duration |
|---|----------|------:|----------:|----------:|-------:|:------------:|
| 1 | Reaction Videos | 3 | 251,788 | 277,697 | 5.3% | 16:38 |

| 6 | **Knowledge** | **127** | **128,660** | **94,484** | **4.9%** | 15:31 |
| 7 | Battery Drain Test | 44 | 122,073 | 99,508 | 2.1% | 9:08 |
| 8 | **Review** | **113** | **119,423** | **95,048** | **4.3%** | 12:18 |
| 9 | Tech Talk | 5 | 119,135 | 118,454 | 5.2% | 20:10 |
| 10 | Launch Events | 8 | 117,296 | 95,403 | 3.5% | 11:04 |
| 11 | First Impressions | 31 | 102,257 | 63,434 | 3.7% | 13:28 |
| 12 | Wassup | 57 | 71,222 | 76,102 | 5.1% | 11:42 |
| 13 | Showcases | 206 | 53,086 | 39,753 | 3.7% | 9:46 |
| 14 | uncategorized | 120 | 62,407 | 40,128 | 4.3% | 10:55 |
| 15 | Shorts | 26 | 7,500 | 5,299 | 3.1% | 0:44 |

### What the Data Says

**Knowledge and Review are the workhorses.** These two categories combined represent **240 videos** (33% of content) and consistently deliver above-average performance. Knowledge videos average 128K views with a 4.9% like rate — the highest engagement among large categories. This means the audience doesn't just passively watch Knowledge content; they actively engage with it.

**Showcases is a volume trap.** With 206 videos (28% of all content), Showcases is the single largest category, yet its average views (53K) are **39% below the channel average**. The median is even worse (39.7K). This is a classic case of a content category that's easy to produce but dilutes the channel's overall performance metrics.

**Battery Drain Test is a hidden gem.** At 44 videos averaging 122K views, this category has remarkably consistent performance (median 99.5K — tightly clustered). Notably, despite being a formulaic format, it has the potential to scale because the format is highly repeatable and search-friendly.

**Shorts are underperforming dramatically.** 26 Shorts averaging just 7,500 views represent the weakest content category by an enormous margin. This is common on YouTube — Shorts viewers have low retention and rarely convert to channel subscribers or long-form viewers.

### Engagement Insights

The categories with the **highest like rates** (a proxy for audience satisfaction) are:

1. **Reaction Videos** — 5.3%
2. **Tech Talk** — 5.2%
3. **Wassup** — 5.1%
4. **Knowledge** — 4.9%

These are all long-form, personality-driven formats. The audience wants depth and opinion — not product showcases.

## 5. Time Series Analysis

### Channel Growth Milestones

| Milestone | Month Reached | Time Taken |
|-----------|:------------:|:----------:|
| 1M views | Dec 2021 | Baseline |
| 5M views | May 2022 | 5 months |
| 10M views | Nov 2022 | 11 months |
| 25M views | Nov 2023 | 23 months |
| 50M views | Apr 2025 | 40 months |

Time-to-milestone is accelerating in absolute terms, though the doubling time from 25M to 50M (17 months) suggests the channel is entering a maturity phase where maintaining growth requires strategic shifts — exactly what the current pivot toward Knowledge content appears to be.

### Quarterly Performance Trend

| Quarter | Videos | Total Views | Avg Views | QoQ Growth |
|---------|-------:|------------:|----------:|-----------:|
| 2022-Q2 | 57 | 3,397,547 | 59,607 | — |
| 2022-Q4 | 51 | 3,267,949 | 64,077 | +7.5% |
| 2023-Q2 | 42 | 4,337,849 | 103,282 | — |
| 2023-Q4 | 38 | 5,030,483 | 132,381 | +28.2% |
| 2024-Q2 | 37 | 3,297,432 | 89,120 | — |
| 2024-Q4 | 69 | 7,576,040 | 109,798 | +23.2% |
| 2025-Q2 | 70 | 4,543,966 | 64,914 | — |
| 2025-Q4 | 32 | 3,706,804 | 115,838 | +78.5% |

**Q4 is consistently the strongest quarter** — this correlates with new phone launches (iPhone, flagship Android), holiday shopping, and "best of" list season. The channel should lean into this pattern.

### Seasonal Patterns

| Month | Avg Views | Performance |
|-------|----------:|:-----------:|
| Jan | 99,775 | ████████████████████████ |
| Feb | 65,779 | ████████████████ |
| Mar | 80,710 | ███████████████████ |
| Apr | 60,445 | ██████████████ |
| May | 79,133 | ███████████████████ |
| Jun | 62,113 | ███████████████ |
| Jul | 75,538 | ██████████████████ |
| Aug | 76,067 | ██████████████████ |
| Sep | 117,771 | █████████████████████████████ |
| Oct | 96,224 | ███████████████████████ |
| Nov | 83,738 | ████████████████████ |
| **Dec** | **121,756** | **██████████████████████████████ ★** |

**December** is the king month (121K avg), followed closely by **September** (117K). Both align with major product launch cycles (iPhone in September, year-end roundups in December). April is the weakest month — a content dead zone between launch cycles.

### Engagement Trajectory

| Quarter | Like Rate | Avg Comments | Engagement Score |
|---------|----------:|-------------:|-----------------:|
| 2021-Q1 | 3.33% | 25 | 4.18 |
| 2022-Q4 | 3.82% | 78 | 5.21 |
| 2023-Q4 | 3.47% | 141 | 4.79 |
| 2024-Q4 | 4.09% | 269 | 6.10 |
| 2025-Q4 | 5.15% | 249 | 7.91 |
| **2026-Q1** | **5.35%** | **269** | **8.58** |

Engagement has been on a **steady, unbroken upward trend** for the past two years. The like rate has climbed from ~3.3% to 5.35% — a **60% increase**. Average comments per video have grown from 25 to 269 — a **10× increase**. This is an exceptionally strong signal: the audience is more invested in TBH Labs content than ever before.

### Current Momentum

| Metric | Previous 3 Months | Last 3 Months | Change |
|--------|-------------------:|--------------:|-------:|
| Avg views | 116,483 | 87,967 | **-24.5%** |
| Upload frequency | 10.3 /month | 17.0 /month | **+65%** |

The channel is currently in a **volume-over-virality** phase — publishing more frequently but with lower per-video averages. This is temporary dilution from increased Shorts and lighter content in the mix. It's not a cause for alarm if the strategic pivot toward Knowledge content is maintained.

### Category Mix Evolution

| Category | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 |
|----------|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|
| Knowledge | 4.5% | 24.7% | 12.4% | 23.8% | 20.7% | **67.6%** |
| Showcases | 0% | 29.6% | 34.6% | 29.1% | 26.6% | 13.5% |
| Review | 0% | 12.3% | 24.8% | 10.5% | 17.6% | 10.8% |
| Shorts | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 13.8% | 0% |

The most dramatic shift: **Knowledge went from 4.5% of content in 2021 to 67.6% in 2026.** Simultaneously, Showcases has been cut nearly in half. This is a deliberate editorial decision and the data overwhelmingly supports it — Knowledge content averages 128K views vs. Showcases at 53K.

## 6. Expert Recommendations

### ✅ What's Working — Double Down

1. **Knowledge is the growth engine.** At 128K avg views, 4.9% like rate, and 67.6% of 2026 content, this is already the channel's strategic bet. The data validates it. Continue increasing the share. Aim for Knowledge to be 50–60% of uploads at steady state, leaving room for complementary categories.

2. **15–20 minute videos are the ideal length.** This is the sweet spot of high views (148K avg), strong engagement, and production feasibility. Target most flagship content at this length. Use 10–15 min for lighter topics and reserve 20–30 min for deep-dive tentpoles.

3. **Tuesday at 8:30 PM MMT is the golden upload slot.** Videos uploaded at this time average 171K views — nearly 2× the channel average. Make this the primary upload window for all flagship content.

4. **Q4 is your cash cow.** September–December consistently outperforms. Plan your biggest productions, collaborations, and tentpole videos for this window. Build a Q4 content calendar 2 months in advance.

### ⚠️ What Needs Attention

5. **Reduce Showcases output.** This category represents 28% of all content but delivers 39% below average views. Either transform Showcases into a more distinctive format (e.g., combine with narrative storytelling) or cut volume by 50% and redirect that production effort into Knowledge or Comparison content.

6. **Kill or rethink Shorts.** At 7,500 avg views, Shorts are the single worst-performing format. In 2025, 13.8% of uploads were Shorts — a significant production investment with minimal return. Shorts rarely convert to long-form subscribers on tech channels because the audience intent is fundamentally different. Unless there's a specific growth experiment, **stop producing Shorts entirely** and reallocate that effort.

7. **Scale the hidden gems:**
   - **Comparison** (7 videos, 158K avg) — highly underproduced. Comparison videos are evergreen, search-friendly, and naturally long-form. Produce 2–3 per month.
   - **Unboxing** (11 videos, 151K avg) — another underproduced winner with consistent performance (median 150K). These are also the most shareable format on social media.
   - **Company Profiles** (3 videos, 133K avg) — narrative-driven format with strong engagement (4.5% like rate). Even 1 per month would significantly uplift the channel average.

8. **Address the "uncategorized" 120 videos.** These represent 16% of all content sitting outside the playlist system. Many of these are strong performers (several 400K+ hits). Categorizing them properly would improve channel organization, playlist recommendations, and session watch time.

### 🎯 Strategic Growth Plays

9. **Create a "Flagship Friday" or "Knowledge Tuesday" brand.** The data shows Tuesday is the best upload day and Knowledge is the best category. Establishing a recurring branded series (e.g., "Knowledge Tuesday" at 8:30 PM MMT) creates audience habit, improves notification click-through rates, and signals consistency to the algorithm.

10. **Build series, not one-offs.** The top-performing categories (Knowledge, Company Profiles, Tech Talk) lend themselves to serialization. A series like "How Things Work" or "Tech Origins" would create playlist binge sessions that dramatically boost session watch time — the #1 algorithm signal on YouTube.

11. **Exploit the September–December window aggressively.** Plan 4–5 tentpole videos for this period:
    - September: Flagship phone launch coverage (iPhone, Pixel)
    - October: 1-month reviews and comparisons
    - November: Black Friday / buying guides
    - December: "Best of the Year" lists + deep-dive retrospective

12. **Experiment with 20–30 minute deep dives.** The data shows 20–30 min videos average 162K views — well above the channel average — but only 40 have been produced. With the audience's appetite for Knowledge content growing (67.6% of 2026 uploads), longer deep dives on topics like AI, semiconductors, and space tech are likely to perform even better than the historical average suggests.

### 📊 KPIs to Track Going Forward
